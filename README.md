## Description
An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

The motivation of this project was to re-create a site and some of its functionality from scratch, using the current live version of it as a template.

### Project Planning:

I have attempted to be as thorough as possible in the planning phase of this project. The following is the result of that effort.

Project architecture

*Note:* The project did not adhere to this plan verbatim, however, it provided an incredibly useful map to follow during development and helped me to build a well-structured project.
